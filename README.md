# Debugging in Java using IntelliJ Q&A

This Q&A document provides a comprehensive guide to debugging Java programs using IntelliJ, one of the most popular integrated development environments (IDEs) for Java development. It covers essential concepts and techniques related to debugging, aimed at helping developers effectively identify and fix bugs and unexpected behaviors in their Java code.

## Contents

The Q&A addresses the following key questions related to debugging in Java using IntelliJ:

1. **The Purpose of a Breakpoint**: Explains the role of breakpoints in debugging, how they allow developers to pause program execution at specific lines of code, and how they aid in analyzing program state, variables, and memory.

2. **Behavior at Breakpoints**: Discusses whether the line of code at a breakpoint executes immediately when starting debugging, highlighting the debugger's behavior in pausing program execution before reaching the breakpoint.

3. **Debugging the Next Line of Code**: Details the "Step Over" command, a useful debugging feature to proceed to the next line of code after hitting a breakpoint, enabling developers to debug code line by line.

4. **Step Into Command**: Explores the "Step Into" command, which enables developers to delve deeper into the code by entering into function or method calls, facilitating a closer examination of internal workings and aiding in debugging.

5. **Difference between Evaluate Expression and Evaluate Code Fragment**: Clarifies the distinctions between "Evaluate Expression" and "Evaluate Code Fragment" features, both of which are designed to inspect and manipulate variables and expressions during debugging, but with different scopes and complexity.
